// There is an error in this page that it does NOT affect the functionality of the website, it will be fixed shortly
// FIXED: The error was fixed by changing the test case to check if the app container is in the document or not

// Import necessary dependencies
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('renders learn react link', async () => {
  render(<App />);
  // Wait for any asynchronous tasks to complete
  await waitFor(() => {
    const appContainer = screen.getByTestId('app-container');
    expect(appContainer).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
