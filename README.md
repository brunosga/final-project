## Current chefs

The website is currently populated with fake chefs for development process and to show how it would look like.

## Notes:

This code was developed By Bruno Almeida with the help of teachers and classmates from the Dorset College, and the use of tools and platforms like:
-[Github](https://github.com)
-[Figma](https://www.figma.com)
-[OpenAi](https://chat.openai.com)
-[Coolors](https://coolors.co)
-[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com)
-[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
-[Firefoo](https://www.firefoo.app)
-[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
-[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp)
-[Mycolor](https://mycolor.space)
-[Munnelly](https://www.munnelly.com)
-[Lunevedy](https://lunevedy.com)

Each and every part of this software was thought and planned carefully

The use of AI(ChatGPT, Github Copilot): OpenAi was for sure of great help during the development of this website - generating specific functions, - helping and giving guidelines to reorganize each component of the code, - re-styling CSS pages and adding new css. - troubleshooting and debugging.

The fact that most page's components, and functions where pasted into ChatGPT and copied several times, in order to troubleshoot or develop, it is possible that commented lines or AI generated code remains within the project for its functionalities and help to manage.

For example, some of the comments about the functionalities of the code was generated automatically with help the of `Github Copilot`

### `About Us Page`

When developing the About Us page, Bruno Almeida, the creator of the platform, wrote a text telling the story behind the process of how the idea flicked on his mind and what he intened to do with his idea. Before adding the text to the About.js file, he sent the text to ChatGPT to proofread the text and add implementations to the text where he could have made grammar mistakes or if there was a better way to express what Bruno intended to say.

`Obs.:` The story IS original, but with the AI modifications the text looks more professional and appealing to the user.
